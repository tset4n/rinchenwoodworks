      <h1>About Rinchen Woodworks</h1>
      <p>Rinchen la learned woodcraft at Norbulingka Institute and built his name through precise Tibetan carving. Life tested him. He faced loss in childhood and later struggled with addiction. With time, reflection, and help, he chose a different path. He has remained sober and rebuilt his craft with quiet focus. Today he runs a small workshop near Norbulingka where every line and symbol carries meaning. “Even a small change in a design can change its message,” he says. With support from Tibet Fund through TibetStartup!, we are helping him share this craft online so more people can find honest, well‑made work rooted in Tibetan heritage.</p>

            <h3>Meet Rinchen la</h3>
            <p><em>Founder, Rinchen Wood Works – Norbulingka</em></p>
            <p>Some call him Pawo, some Par Desi.
            Rinchen la came to India from Tibet when he was just 8 years old — completely alone. He never saw his parents again. They passed away while he was still here, in exile, and he never got the chance to say goodbye. That loss has stayed with him quietly, over the years.</p>
            <p>He learned woodcraft at Norbulingka Institute — a skill he slowly mastered through dedication and hard work. But life outside the workshop was full of struggle. He was often taken advantage of, made to work by people he trusted, and left unpaid or unrecognized.</p>
            <p>In 1994, during a violent clash between locals and Tibetans, his workplace in lower Dharamsala was burned down. After that, he travelled across India, earning respect and recognition for his remarkable precision in Tibetan woodwork.</p>
            <p>But somewhere along the way, things got difficult. He slipped into alcohol addiction, and for a while, that became what people knew him for not his craft, but his drinking. Some of his lowest moments were even shared online, turning real pain into something to laugh at.</p>
            <p>Eventually, he reached a turning point. It was not just one thing it was many. Time spent in a rehabilitation centre gave him space to reflect and rebuild. Losing a close friend to alcohol added to the wake-up call. And little by little, Rinchen la made the choice to change. He left behind drinking completely — not a single sip since — and started over.</p>
            <p>Now in his late 40s, unmarried and living simply, Rinchen la runs Rinchen Wood Works at Norbulingka. He carves sacred Tibetan designs with meaning, intention, and spiritual precision. “Even a small change in a design,” he says, “can destroy its whole message.”</p>
            <p>He is not just creating beautiful pieces he’s preserving the depth of Tibetan tradition. His vision is to ensure that this ancient craft is respected for what it truly is full of purpose, prayer, and centuries of wisdom.</p>
            <p>With support from Tibet Fund through TibetStartup!, we are now helping him bring his work into the digital space from branding and legal support to building a professional website and social media platforms. He is one of ten small Tibetan businesses in Dharamsala we’re supporting this year.</p>
            <p>Rinchen la’s story is a reminder that healing takes time — and that no one is beyond repair. He fell, yes. But he also rose — through his craft, through his choices, and through the quiet power of starting again.</p>
